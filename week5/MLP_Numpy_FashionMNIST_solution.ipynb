        "The dataset is referred to as \"Fashion-MNIST\" as a reference to the much older but still very popular MNIST dataset. The rationale behind this reference is that the dataset has similar properties. It can thus be used in the exact same manner as MNIST has been used for years of research.\n",

While there is many novel libraries that abstract away all the math and algorithms, it is a good practice to go through the basics in detail once before moving on to the more complex CNN or RNN examples.\n",

However it's sort of inconvenient given that you have to download files by hand, unpack them, call their API etc.\n",

        "We have given a minimal example of what such a data-loader could look like below. For now, you should examine it and try to understand the individual components. When we move to the next session where we will implement a CNN with a modern Deep Learning framework such as PyTorch, we will see how easily we could extend this data-loader to be included there. Of course the PyTorch developers have already done that for us, but we will go through the practice nevertheless. This way you can learn how to contribute to modern Deep Learning software and potentially even do a pull-request of your own dataset or some other non-wrapped dataset at some point in time.\n",

        "* 1.) The used error metric is linear and thus makes it harder to learn for the model when high accuracies are reached (because error and output values are very close and lead to small gradients). Implement a Cross-entropy criterion based on the log-softmax function followed by the negative log-likelihood instead. Why is this a better choice for a multi-class classification problem? \n",
        "* 2.) The above example only used the training set and monitored the training error. This is generally a bad idea because we have no notion of over-fitting. Use the given validation set to monitor your error and decide a suitable stopping point. \n"
